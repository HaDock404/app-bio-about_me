# APP About Me

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Here is my presentation app using React that provides a simple and powerful interface while maintaining app performance.   

## Description  

This application enables me to present my professional experience in an interactive way for the user by activating different animations using the page scroll. The images were designed and drawn by me then transformed into SVG to maintain the same quality depending on the different screen sizes.  

Here some exemples of the differents stages of the application.
